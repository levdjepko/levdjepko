- 👋 Hi, I’m Lev!
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of development, but mostly related to the data, ETL, and business logic (back-end)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java. I have an upcoming class that heavily utilizes it, and want to be as prepared as possible :)
- I really enjoy solving tough problems, finding efficient solutions, and creating new classes for my collection!

- 📫 You can reach me on *LinkedIn* (https://www.linkedin.com/in/lev-dzhepko/)
